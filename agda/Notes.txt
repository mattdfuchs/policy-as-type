an attribute value is a datatype of some sort

some are finite valued

some (time of day) have unlimited values

attributes are attributes of an entity

entities include
- the requesting agent
- the executing system
- a trusted source (which can sign things)
- a service

A trusted source TS has a list of methods for the attributes it supports
- a call takes another entity as parameter and returns a dependent pair of attr value and Proof

A service call is a tuple of values with in a dependent pair (does it need to be a triple?  Perhaps a response that's a also a dependent pair?)

The dependent type of the service invocation is a predicate over attributes, where the attribute has a value and a proof of correctness.
